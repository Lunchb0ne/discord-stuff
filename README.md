# Discord themes

### How to use

To load custom stylesheets, install [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord), [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord). These themes require [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) for optimal appearance.

Only tested on Linux with EnhancedDiscord. Modifying Discord goes against their TOS so *use at your own risk*.

## Bliss

Sleek, flat theme with support for both light and dark modes. Colors can be modified in the `.theme-dark` and `.theme-light` sections.

If you would like to use colors generated by [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) there is an SCSS file provided which you will need to compile on each update.
