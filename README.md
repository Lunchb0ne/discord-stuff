# Stuff that I made for Discord

**How to use:**

The plugins were made to be used with [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord).

To load custom stylesheets, install EnhancedDiscord, [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord). Some of these themes require [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) for optimal appearance.

Only tested on Linux with EnhancedDiscord. Modifying Discord goes against their TOS so ***use at your own risk***.

# Themes

## Bliss

Sleek, flat theme with support for both light and dark modes. Colors can be modified in the `.theme-dark` and `.theme-light` sections.

If you would like to use colors generated by [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) there is an SCSS file provided which you will need to compile on each update.
