# Discord themes

### How to use

To load custom stylesheets, install [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord), [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord). Most (if not all) of these themes require [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) for optimal appearance.

Only tested on Linux with EnhancedDiscord. Modifying Discord goes against their TOS so *use at your own risk*.
